There is a button on the back of the clock.

**Long press** the button for 2 seconds. Let go when the hours digit starts flashing.

**Click** the button to change the digit.

**Long press** the button for 2 seconds to move to the next digit. (The minutes digits are set separately.)

**Click** the button to change the digit.

Repeat for the last digit.

Hold the button again to return to the regular clock mode.

_NOTE:_ If you unplug the clock, the time it was unplugged is stored and loaded next time you plug it in. So if you unplug it and replug 5 minutes later, it will be 5 minutes behind.
