The Rainbow Clock is a simple grid of LEDs that displays the time in a rainbow gradient. It was designed to facilitate learning LED programming, so that someone can just plug the Rainbow Clock into their computer, and follow this guide to start lighting up LEDs with their own colors and patterns!

The purpose of this guide is both to walk you through writing your own LED code and to provide explanations about how the clock works. Here is a list of every page in this guide. You can find this same list of links in the sidebar.
