This LED Rainbow Clock starts out as a basic digital clock, but it's even more than that. This is a tool to learn how to program LEDs. This website you are on right now is a guide on how to upload your own code to this clock and light up the grid of pixels with your own patterns. The clock can either be used as a regular clock or as an educational tool.

This guide walks you through step-by-step how to download the necessary software onto your computer, how to upload code to the clock, and how to code several basic pixel patterns and animations. The guide also contains a breakdown of all the code that runs the clock functionality: how the time is tracked, how a button press is captured, how the time is set using the button, how the pixels light up in a rainbow, etc. If you upload your own code to the clock, the guide contains a section on how to re-upload the original clock code.


### Where to buy a clock

The clock is available to buy on either [my online store](https://mickymakes.square.site/product/rainbow-clock/3) or [my Etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1656722711/learn-to-code-leds-led-rainbow-clock).


### Where to begin

The sidebar lists all the pages in this guide. If you want to understand more about how the clock is built, check out the pages in the "About the Rainbow Clock" section. If you're ready to start coding, dive into [Setup environment](write-your-own-led-code/setup-environment).
