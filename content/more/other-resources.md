### Arduino examples

- The Arduino IDE comes with loads of well explained examples. In the Arduino IDE go to File -> Examples. Most libraries you install like FastLED also include examples that show up in the same File -> Examples menu after you install the library.


### LEDs

- [Adafruit NeoPixel Ãœberguide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide): Everything you need to know about NeoPixels. Best practices, wiring, power, software, and more.


### Other guides

- [Adafruit learning system](https://learn.adafruit.com) has a plethora of amazing guides for learning LEDs, Arduino, ESP32, buttons, sensors, and more. [Here are the LED guides](https://learn.adafruit.com/category/leds).
- [Random Nerd Tutorials](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/) is full of guides on ESP32, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and coding. Their guides are extremely well written, clear, and thorough. They were a big inspiration for me to want to write guides.
